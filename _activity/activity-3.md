As the representative of the graduate students, I was invited to participate as a sharing guest in the Introductory Seminar for Researchers, where I shared my experiences, insights, and reflections on participating in innovation and entrepreneurship competitions and engaging in scientific research with my fellow students. My contribution was highly appreciated by the organizers of the event and was covered by the [school media](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5oeBTvX65fLolHze6YugIw?poc_token=HI-KaWWjiEHlJSSxbGm17pqb89_Emw6_hhYsjbXs).

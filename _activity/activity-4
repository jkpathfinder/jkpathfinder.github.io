As an outstanding Master's student representative, I was invited to participate as a keynote speaker in the Science and Innovation Exchange Meeting for Undergraduate, Master\'s and Ph.D. Programs. I shared information on the process, methods, and key points for participating in innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, and my participation was covered by the [school news website](http://news.hust.edu.cn/info/1004/50729.htm).

Transformer, as one of the most advanced neural network models in Natural Language Processing (NLP), exhibits diverse applications in the field of anomaly detection. To inspire research on Transformer-based anomaly detection, this review offers a fresh perspective on the concept of anomaly detection. We explore the current challenges of anomaly detection and provide detailed insights into the operating principles of Transformer and its variants in anomaly detection tasks. Additionally, we delineate various application scenarios for Transformer-based anomaly detection models and discuss the datasets and evaluation metrics employed. Furthermore, this review highlights the key challenges in Transformer-based anomaly detection research and conducts a comprehensive analysis of future research trends in this domain. The review includes an extensive compilation of over 100 core references related to Transformer-based anomaly detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review that focuses on the research related to Transformer in the context of anomaly detection. We hope that this paper can provide detailed technical information to researchers interested in Transformer-based anomaly detection tasks.

The present invention discloses a normalized log generation method based on the principle of entropy increase, which belongs to the field of database log auditing technology. The method comprises: determining the entropy values of each field in the current log based on the principle of entropy increase; determining whether each field is important or non-important based on the comparison between the entropy value of the corresponding field and a set threshold; setting an associated primary key corresponding to the current log, which uniquely represents the mapping relationship between all the important fields and non-important fields in the current log; transforming the current log into a normalized log structure including important fields, the primary key, and non-important fields. This approach utilizes the entropy increase principle for normalization, effectively handling raw logs from multiple sources with different structures, and demonstrating strong generalization ability. In addition, the normalized log structure, which contains important fields, non-important fields, and associated primary keys, has a consistent and concise format, allowing for rapid iterative upgrades as the log structure evolves.

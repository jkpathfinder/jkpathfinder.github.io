The present invention discloses an evidence generation method, device, and system based on multivariate collaborative analysis, belonging to the field of database management technology. The evidence generation method comprises: obtaining data storage structures from distributed search engines; using a multi-dimensional collaborative analysis algorithm to search for data items that meet the preset conditions from the data storage structure; conducting correlation analysis between the screened data items and template evidence, and selecting key data content; expanding and parsing key fields to obtain preliminary evidence for key data content; Standardizing the preliminary evidence to generate a standardized evidence format. Due to its ability to effectively solve the pain points of low efficiency and missing key information in conventional data query and evidence generation schemes, the multi-dimensional collaborative analysis algorithm has improved the accuracy of information query and screening, as well as the efficiency and universality of evidence generation. It also provides strong support for various downstream tasks such as evidence correlation analysis, evidence auditing, evidence chain generation, and cross-authentication.

I'm a third-year graduate student from [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](http://cse.hust.edu.cn/), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/). My research interests include deep learning, neural networks, natural language processing, artificial intelligence security, and large language models. Concretely, I delve deeper into theoretical models in deep learning, such as Multi-head attention mechanism, Transformer and related variants, Graph Neural Networks, etc., and focus more on architecture innovation and performance optimization. I also actively advance the exploratory applications of related models in various downstream tasks, including multivariate time series data processing, webshell text detection, code similarity analysis, etc.
You can find my CV here: [Mingrui Ma's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf). I hope to exchange and learn from excellent AI scientists worldwide and together build a healthy AI ecosystem.

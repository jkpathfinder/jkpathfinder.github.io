I'm a second-year graduate student from [School of CSE](http://cse.hust.edu.cn/), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/). My research interests include deep learning, neural networks, natural language processing, artificial intelligence security, and large language models.
You can find my CV here: [Mingrui Ma's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf). I hope to exchange and learn from excellent AI scientists worldwide and together build a healthy AI ecosystem.
